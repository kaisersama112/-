## 简介

​	目前大多数所谓的金融模型大多是基于公共知识进行训练的，但在实际的金融领域，这些公共知识对于当前市场的可解释性往往严重不足。如果有兴趣，可以了解一下凯恩斯、弗里德曼乃至现在行为金融学的各种主张。据我观察，大多数金融模型都无法做出投资判断。因为他们接受的是普通教科书、入门级分析师考试、甚至公司公开报告的培训。我认为这对于投资来说价值很小。

​	你可以认为我在开玩笑，但事实是，很多主观分析师的逻辑可能没有34b及以上的大模型那么严谨（当然不包括那些优秀的）。市场每时每刻都在变化，实时有大量新闻和海量数据。对于大多数散户来说，与其等待蹩脚的分析师写报告，为什么不使用大模型来做管道呢？

​	在我的计划中，这个模型是这个过程的基础模型。在我的计划中，信息收集器、目标判断器、定性分析器、定量分析器、数据提取器等模型都是这个过程的一部分。但模型本身对于掌握大量的定性和定量方法无疑是重要的。这就是这个模型诞生的原因。

## 评估过程

​	首先对这些新闻进行去重、主观和客观的判断。这些都可以通过传统的BERT来解决。那么对于deepmoney来说，采用三个步骤来处理传入的消息：

1. 上述消息可能影响哪些行业或投资标的？
2. 请设计一个定量方法来研究上述消息对行业的影响。并相应地解释需要使用哪些数据。
3. 请根据以下数据，设计一套具体的量化方法，定量分析上述消息对行业的影响。

​	其中，第一个问题是主观判断和新闻影响目标的提取。这更多地依赖于模型的主观分析能力。然后从第一个答案中提取行业名称（对于熟悉大型模型的人来说，很容易设计自动化流程）并填写到第二个问题中，目的是获取数据进行定量分析。之所以先问定量方法，再问数据，这就是COT的神奇之处。最后一个问题的答案才是我们真正需要的。这个问题的背景信息已经足够多了，需要用准确、具体的定量方法来回答。结合代码编写模型和函数调用模型，如果你有宏微观数据库，有完整的数据字典，这是完全可以实现的。以下是 DeepMoney 和 GPT4 的三步答案：

Please design a quantitative method to study the impact of the above news on the pharmaceutical industry. And accordingly explain what data needs to be used.

ANS:
To quantitatively analyze the impact of this acquisition news on the pharmaceutical industry, we can use regression analysis or other statistical modeling techniques. The key is to identify independent variables that might influence stock prices in the pharmaceutical sector and then determine how much each variable affects changes in stock price.

Here's an overview of the steps involved in designing such a quantitative approach:

Step 1: Data Collection
Collect historical data for the period you wish to study (e.g., quarterly or yearly) from various sources like Bloomberg, Yahoo Finance, etc. Here's a list of some potential datasets needed:

* Stock market indices related to pharmaceutical industries both locally (e.g., S&P Pharmaceutical Index) and globally (e.gs&p Global Healthcare Index)
* Financial performance indicators of major players within the same space as GSK/Aiolos Bio and those affected by their acquisitions
* News sentiment scores around similar deals in the past
* Macroeconomic factors like GDP growth rate, inflation rates, interest rates, etc.
* Industry specific factors like R&D spending trends, regulatory environment changes, patent expirations, etc.

Step 2: Model Selection
After collecting all relevant information, choose suitable econometric models depending upon the nature of relationships between dependent & independent variables. Ordinary Least Squares Regression would work if linearity assumption holds true; otherwise, Logit/Probit model could be considered too.

Step 3: Variable selection
Selecting appropriate explanatory variables after checking multicollinearity among them using VIF values. This will help us understand which variables have significant effects on stock returns.

Step 4: Hypothesis testing
Perform hypothesis tests like F-test, t-test, Durbin-Watson test, etc., to check whether our chosen regressors are statistically significant at different levels of significance.

Step 5: Coefficient interpretation
Interpret coefficients obtained from Step 4 while keeping mind signs and magnitudes must align with economic theory. Positive coefficient means positive relationship whereas negative implies inverse relation.

Step 6: Model evaluation
Evaluate goodness-of-fit measures like R^2, Adjusted R^2, Akaike Information Criterion(AIC), Bayesian Information Criterion(BIC), Root Mean Square Error(RMSE), Mean Absolute Deviation(MAD),etc.,to ascertain model fitness.

Step 7: Forecasting
Use estimated parameters along with future exogenous variable values to predict future outcomes for any given time period.

In conclusion, this quantitative methodology aims to measure the effect of GSKS's acquisition on the overall pharmaceutical industry by studying its impacts on stock prices and financial performances across several companies in the field.

Based on the following data, please design a specific set of quantitative methods to quantitatively analyze the impact of the above news on the pharmaceutical industry.

* Stock market indices related to pharmaceutical industries both locally (e.g., S&P Pharmaceutical Index) and globally (e.gs&p Global Healthcare Index)
* Financial performance indicators of major players within the same space as GSK/Aiolos Bio and those affected by their acquisitions
* News sentiment scores around similar deals in the past
* Macroeconomic factors like GDP growth rate, inflation rates, interest rates, etc.
* Industry specific factors like R&D spending trends, regulatory environment changes, patent expirations, etc.

ANS:
To quantitatively analyze the impact of this news on the pharmaceutical industry, we can use several quantitative methods that involve analyzing stock prices, financial performance indicators, news sentiment scores, macroeconomic factors, and industry-specific factors. Here is an outline of how you might go about it:

1. Stock Market Indices Analysis: Monitor daily or weekly fluctuations in local (e.g., S&P Pharmaceutical Index) and global (e.g., s&p Global Healthcare Index) stock market indices related to the pharmaceutical industry before, during, and after the announcement of the acquisition. Analyze these fluctuations using statistical techniques such as regression analysis, ANOVA testing, or time series analysis to determine whether there were significant price movements due to this event.
2. Financial Performance Indicators: Examine the financial performance metrics of other companies operating in the same therapeutic area(s) as Aiolos Bio and GSK prior to the acquisition announcement. These could include revenue growth rates, net income margins, return on equity (ROE) ratios, earnings per share (EPS), etc. Then compare them with post-acquisition figures for any noticeable differences that may have resulted from the deal. You can also look at the overall profitability trend among firms within the same space to gauge its potential effect on investor confidence.
3. News Sentiment Scores: Collect media coverage surrounding previous mergers & acquisitions (M&As) involving biotech startups similar to Aiolos Bio over a certain period (e..g 5 years). Use natural language processing tools or machine learning algorithms to extract positive/negative sentiments associated with each article. Compare these scores against historical averages for M&As within the pharma sector; if they deviate significantly, it could indicate heightened investor optimism or pessimism towards future deals.
4. Macroeconomic Factors: Track key economic indicators such as GDP growth rates, inflation rates, interest rates, exchange rates, unemployment levels, etc., across different countries where major players in the industry operate. Assess correlations between these variables and changes observed in pharmaceutical stocks' performances to understand their sensitivity to broader economic conditions.
5. Industry Specific Factors: Keep track of recent developments in the healthcare industry, such as shifts in regulatory environments, patent expirations, advancements in drug discovery technologies, and pricing policies. Evaluate the extent to which these events influence valuations of companies involved in similar transactions and identify common patterns affecting the entire sector.
6. Regression Modeling: Develop multiple linear regressions incorporating all identified drivers mentioned above as independent variables along with dependent variable being either individual company stock returns or index level changes representing the whole pharmaceutical sector. Perform backward elimination technique to arrive at most parsimonious model explaining maximum variation in dependent variable while keeping only statistically significant predictors. This will help us isolate unique contribution made by each factor including the aforementioned news event.
7. Monte Carlo Simulation: Lastly run Monte Carlo simulations based on estimated coefficients from finalized regression models by generating thousands of random samples reflecting distributional assumptions made about each driver variable. By repeating process many times, one can obtain probability distributions for predicted outcomes under various scenarios considering uncertainty inherent in estimating parameters accurately.
8. Conclusion: Based on results obtained from analyses described above, draw inferences regarding likely impacts of said transaction on valuation multiples of comparable companies operating within same space or even entire sectors. Make recommendations concerning investment decisions taking into account risk appetite and available information sources used throughout investigation process.
